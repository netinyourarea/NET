                    <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                    <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
                    <p>If you have any dispute with Net in your area, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@netinyourarea.com">support@netinyourarea.com</a> to attempt to resolve the issue informally.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Arbitration</h3>
                    <p>If informal resolution fails, any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
                    <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the dispute between you and Net in your area individually. To the full extent permitted by law, no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other or proceed on a class-action basis.</p>
